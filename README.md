# Machine-Learning-Based-Prediction-of-CO2-Emissions-in-the-U.S.-add_back_2303
This project focuses on analyzing and classifying CO₂ emissions across the United States by examining trends based on state, sector, and fuel type. Using machine learning, the project aims to classify emission levels into Low, Medium, and High, offering actionable insights for sustainability and policy-making.

## **Objective**

The goal of this project is to uncover patterns in CO₂ emissions and classify emission levels effectively. Machine learning models are employed to predict emission categories, and their performances are evaluated for accuracy and reliability.

## **Key Steps**

### **1. Data Preprocessing**
- Cleaned the dataset by handling missing values.
- Encoded categorical variables into numeric formats.
- Scaled numerical features for better model performance.

### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Created visualizations to explore trends in CO₂ emissions:
  - Emission patterns by state.
  - Sector-wise and fuel-type contributions.
  - Yearly trends in CO₂ emissions.

### **3. Machine Learning Models**
Three classifiers were applied to categorize emission levels:
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

### **4. Model Comparison**
Evaluated the models using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. Visualizations, including confusion matrices and accuracy comparisons, were created to highlight the performance differences.
